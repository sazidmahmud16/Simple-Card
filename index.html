                    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. </p>

                    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet, it is a style sheet language used to shape the HTML elements that will be displayed in the browsers as a web-page. Without using CSS, the website which has been created by using HTML, will look dull. Basically CSS gives the outer cover on any HTML elements. If you consider HTML as a skeleton of the web-page then the CSS will be the skin of the skeleton. The Internet media type (MIME type) of CSS is text/CSS. The CSS was developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in the year of 1996. The CSS can be applied to HTML documents in different ways.</p>
